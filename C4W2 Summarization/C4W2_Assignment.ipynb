    "\n",
    "Welcome to the second assignment of course 4. In this assignment you will explore summarization using the transformer model. Yes, you will implement the transformer decoder from scratch, but we will slowly walk you through it. There are many hints in this notebook so feel free to use them as needed. Actually by the end of this notebook you will have implemented the full transformer (both encoder and decoder) but you will only be graded on the implementation of the decoder as the encoder is provided for you.\n"

For example, bots can be used to scrape articles, summarize them, and then you can use sentiment analysis to identify the sentiment about certain stocks. Who wants to read an article or a long email today anyway, when you can build a transformer to summarize text for you? Let's get started. By completing this assignment you will learn to:  \n",

    "If you critically examine the output of the model, you can notice a few things:\n",
    " - In the training set the model output is (almost) identical to the real output (already after 20 epochs and even more so with more epochs). This might be because the training set is relatively small and the model is relatively big and has thus learned the sentences in the training set by heart (overfitting).\n",
    " - While the performance on the training set looks amazing, it is not so good on the test set. The model overfits, but fails to generalize. Again an easy candidate to blame is the small training set and a comparatively large model, but there might be a variety of other factors.\n",
    " - Look at the test set example 3 and its summarization. Would you summarize it the same way as it is written here? Sometimes the data may be ambiguous. And the training of **your model can only be as good as your data**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here you only use a small dataset, to show that something can be learned in a reasonable amount of time in a relatively small environment. Generally, large transformers are trained on more than one task and on very large quantities of data to achieve superb performance. You will learn more about this in the rest of this course."
